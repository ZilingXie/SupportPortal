# Collaboration Rules

## Branch Workflow
1. By default, all Codex changes for this repo must be made directly on the `mac` branch.
2. Do not create temporary `codex/*` branches unless the user explicitly asks for branch isolation for multiple independent large changes.
3. If the user requests isolated branch work, create the separate branch from `mac` unless the user says otherwise.

## UI Design Source Of Truth
1. All new or refactored UI under `ui/` must follow `/Users/xieziling/Desktop/personal_proj/SupportPortal/design.md`.
2. `design.md` is the canonical UI design language and component/style source of truth for this repo.
3. `docs/agent.md` is kept only as a compatibility redirect and must not be treated as an independent spec.
4. If a UI change needs new tokens, component rules, or page-level exceptions, update `design.md` before implementing the code.

## Container Handling After Changes
1. After completing code changes, always restart containers with compose down first, then compose up:
   - `podman-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.single-host.yml down`
   - `podman-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.single-host.yml up -d --build`
2. After restart, verify running status:
   - `podman-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.single-host.yml ps`

## RAG Change Logging
1. Every RAG-related change must be appended to `/Users/xieziling/Desktop/personal_proj/SupportPortal/docs/rag_change_log.md` before the task is considered complete.
2. RAG-related changes include retrieval logic, chunking strategy, ingestion flow, embedding configuration, evaluation logic, vector tables, and any RAG data reset or backfill.
3. Each entry must include the date, summary, reason, affected files or config, data impact, and verification evidence.
