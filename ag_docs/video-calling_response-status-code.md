# Response status codes

This page describes all response status codes returned when calling the channel management RESTful API.

If the status code is `200`, the request is successful. If not, troubleshoot the problem based on the `message` and `reason` fields that may appear in the corresponding response body.

For example, when a request fails, you might receive the following response:

```json
# 400 Bad Request
{
  "message": "invalid appid"
}
```

### Status codes

The following table summarizes all response status codes, their meanings, and recommended actions:

| Response status code | Description | Recommended actions |
| :------------------- | :------------ ------------------- |
| 200        | The operation is successful.   | No troubleshooting required. |
| 400        | Bad request.         | Troubleshoot based on the `message` field in the response body. |
| 401        | Unauthorized.        | Check and confirm that your authentication information is correct. Possible reasons include: <li>App ID does not exist</li><li> Non-matching customer ID and secret</li>|
| 403        | Access is forbidden. | The authorization information is incorrect. Contact [Agora technical support](https://docs-md.agora.io/en/mailto:support@agora.io.md). |
| 404        | The requested resource could not be found. | Confirm that the requested URL and resource are correct. |
| 415        | Unsupported media type.  | Make sure you have set `Content-Type` in the request header as `application/json`. |
| 429        | Too many requests.   | Wait and retry. |
| 500        | Internal server error.    | Use a backoff strategy for query requests or contact [Agora technical support](https://docs-md.agora.io/en/mailto:support@agora.io.md) |

> ℹ️ **Note**
> If the problem is not solved after taking the recommended action, print out the `X-Request-ID` and `X-Resource-ID` response header values and contact [technical support](https://docs-md.agora.io/en/mailto:support@agora.io.md).

### Troubleshooting example

A call to create a privilege banning rule returns `400 Bad Request` and the `message` filed value is `invalid appid`. 

This means that the App ID is invalid and the rule creation has failed. Obtain the App ID in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/v2) and call the API again.
